# 🌈 Unlimited Colours

A simple JavaScript project that changes the background color of the webpage every second using randomly generated hex colors.

# 🚀 How It Works

Click Start → the background begins changing to a new random color every second.

Click Stop → the color-changing interval stops.

Colors are generated using a custom randomColor() function that builds a hex color code.

# 📁 Files

index.html — Contains the page layout and buttons.

style.css — Basic styling for the page and buttons.

script.js — Handles color generation and interval control.

# ▶️ Usage

Open index.html in any browser and click Start to see the color magic!
